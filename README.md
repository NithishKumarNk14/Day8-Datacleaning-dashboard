## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw sales data.
- Engineer new features for deeper insights.
- Create a business-oriented dashboard to visualize:

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Convert Date Columns**:
   - `Order Date`, `Ship Date` → `datetime` format.
2. **Handle Missing Values**:
   - `Postal Code`: 11 missing values filled with placeholder `-1`.
3. **Remove Duplicates**
4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - `Shipping Duration`, `Order Year`, `Order Month`, etc.
5. **Data Type Consistency**:
   - Postal codes and IDs converted to strings for categorical use.

The dashboard (see `Book1.pdf`) includes:

- **Sales by Region and City**
